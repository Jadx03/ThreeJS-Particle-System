For our senior design project we decided to tackle a web based particles system utilizing ThreeJS.

## Functionality

Along with an interactive display of our scene and particle system, we will provide some basic functionality to allow the user
to design their own various effects based upon our presets.

These settings include, but are not limited to
- Color gradient of particles
- Emitting radius
- Physical parametters
- Lifetime of particles
- Textures used to draw particles
- etc.

### Dependencies (all includes in the /js file)
- [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
- [DatGUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
